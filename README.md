# Homework 2: Puzzle Game
This is a drag and drop puzzle game developed for Homework #2, for the Multimedia Authoring 2 classes, of Interactive Media Design (IDP3) graduation program on Fanshawe College, Summer semester, 2024.

## Installation
1. Click on the link to the sample repository provided;
2. On the repo, click on the green button "< > Code";
3. On the last option, click on "Download zip";
4. Unzip the folder.

## Usage
1. Download the folder on your device;
2. Open the index.html file on the browser of your choice.

## History
Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were discovered in class. This is a research assignment -
solve the problems outlined in the brief.

Create new branches (named appropriately) and update the functionality to improve the game UX.

### Requirements
In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone -
this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time.

The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed /
reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.

Solve these two problems. You can use the original drop function to solve the first problem, and another function for the second. Try
experimenting with calling one function from another - you might not need to add any event handling to solve these issues, just extend
the functionality.

Write out your plan FIRST. You can’t solve a problem - coding or otherwise - if you don’t understand what you need to do. Reason about
the problem - think it through. Articulating the solution first will be a great help in completing the assignment successfully.

### Additional Requirements
1. Include a written plan / path with your submission. Analyze the problem and provide the solution.
2. Create a Readme.md document for the repo with detailed information about the project.
3. Create a branch for each bug and its solution. Provide the JS for each.
4. Merge everything to the master branch (keep all branches in your repo).

### Submission
Project must be submitted within Week 8 class time: ONLY THE MAIN BRANCH WILL BE GRADED.NOT ZIPPED FILES!

- Github repo: readme.md file, master branch, design branch and development branch
- Correct structure for a web project (css, js, images and index.html)
- Name the dev branches appropriately per feature IE des.tvr.artwork, dev.tvr.script

### Grading Rubrics
- Folder Setup & Naming /1
- GitHub Best Practices /3
- Documentation/Plan /2
- Fixing Bugs /4
- TOTAL = 10
